# **TYPES OF CORROSION AND THEIR THEORIES (Short Answer)**

# **1. Dry or Chemical Corrosion**

Dry corrosion occurs by **direct chemical attack** of atmospheric gases (O₂, SO₂, CO₂, H₂S, halogens) or **anhydrous liquids** on a metal surface **without moisture**.

### **Types of Chemical Corrosion**

1. **Oxidation Corrosion**

   * Direct attack of oxygen at low or high temperature.
   * All metals oxidize at high temperature except **Ag, Au, Pt**.
   * Alkali and alkaline earth metals oxidize rapidly.

2. **Corrosion by other gases**

   * Gases such as **SO₂, CO₂, H₂S, F₂** react chemically with metals to form sulfides, fluorides, etc.

3. **Liquid Metal Corrosion**

   * When a molten metal dissolves or reacts with a solid metal.

## **Mechanism of Oxidation Corrosion**

* Oxygen reacts with the metal surface forming an **oxide scale**.
* This scale acts as a barrier. For further oxidation to continue:

  * Metal ions must **diffuse outward** through the scale, or
  * Oxygen must **diffuse inward** to the metal.
* **Metal ion diffusion is faster** because metal ions are **smaller and more mobile** than oxide ions.
* Hence oxide grows mainly **outwards**.

## **Nature of the Oxide Layer**

* **Stable oxide** → adherent, non-porous, protective (Al, Cu, Sn).
* **Unstable oxide** → decomposes back into metal + oxygen (Ag, Au, Pt do not oxidize).
* **Volatile oxide** → evaporates and leaves surface exposed (Mo → MoO₃).
* **Porous oxide** → cracked, allows oxygen to reach metal, corrosion continues (FeS).

---

## **Pilling–Bedworth Rule**

* If **volume of oxide ≥ volume of metal**, oxide is **protective**.
* If **volume of oxide < volume of metal**, oxide is **porous and non-protective**.
* Alkali/alkaline earth metals form porous oxides → corrode rapidly.
* Aluminium forms a compact oxide → protected.

# **2. Wet or Electrochemical Corrosion**

Wet corrosion occurs when a metal is in contact with a **conducting liquid (moisture/electrolyte)** or when **two dissimilar metals** are partially/fully immersed in an electrolyte.

### **Principle**

* Separate **anodic** and **cathodic** regions develop on the metal.
* **Anode:** oxidation → metal dissolves → corrosion occurs here.
  [
  M \rightarrow M^{n+} + ne^-
  ]
* **Cathode:** reduction → no metal dissolution.
  Electrons released at anode travel to cathode through the metal.
* Positive metal ions and negative ions (OH⁻, O²⁻) meet in the electrolyte and form corrosion products.

### **Requirements**

1. Anodic and cathodic areas
2. Electrical contact
3. Electrolyte (moisture)
4. Corrosion at anode only
5. Corrosion product forms between anode and cathode

# **Mechanism of Wet Corrosion**

**Anodic reaction (always):**
[
M \rightarrow M^{n+} + ne^-
]

**Cathodic reaction may be:**

### **A) Hydrogen Evolution (Acidic Medium)**

* Occurs in acids.
* Example (iron):
  **Anode:**
  [
  Fe \rightarrow Fe^{2+} + 2e^-
  ]
  **Cathode:**
  [
  2H^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow H_2 \uparrow
  ]
* Overall:
  [
  Fe + 2H^+ \rightarrow Fe^{2+} + H_2
  ]
* Anode = large area; cathode = small area.

### **B) Oxygen Absorption (Neutral or Alkaline Medium)**
Here is a **short, exam-ready** explanation of **Oxygen Absorption Corrosion** with reaction:

---

# **Oxygen Absorption Corrosion (Short Answer)**

Oxygen absorption corrosion occurs in **neutral or alkaline solutions**, where dissolved oxygen acts as the **oxidizing agent**. The metal dissolves at the **anode**, while oxygen is **reduced at the cathode** to form hydroxide ions.

### **Reactions (Example: Iron)**

**Anode:**
[
Fe \rightarrow Fe^{2+} + 2e^-
]

**Cathode (oxygen reduction):**
[
O_2 + 2H_2O + 4e^- \rightarrow 4OH^-
]

**Overall reaction:**
[
2Fe + O_2 + 2H_2O \rightarrow 2Fe(OH)_2
]

Ferrous hydroxide later oxidizes to **rust (Fe₂O₃·xH₂O)**.
